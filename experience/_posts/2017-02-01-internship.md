title: End-year-Project - SOM Consulting
description: >
  I started my End-year-project at SOM Consulting company, in which we worked on the development of a sentiment analysis platform. We collected over 4 million tweets related to French Election 2017, and we arrived to predict the elected candidate before the publishing of the election results, by the end of the project we managed to publish a chapter in the book of  "Innovations in Smart cities and Applications [1]"
